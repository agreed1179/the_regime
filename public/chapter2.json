That man there with just 1 arm, he talk with hope and excitement and he is more alive than he has ever been since he lost his son in the war. \n\n Some years later, your country is now winning wars. It dealt devastating blows to the powers that once enslaved you. \n\n Ask yourself this. could you really resist the allure of Hitler at that time? Could you truly say that you won't be swayed by him? \n\n Some years down the line, your situation drastically improved. You now eat better, sleep better, and your children went to not factories but school. Your leader demonstrated his genius military leadership and one after another you conquered the people who oppressed you for decades. You see some people disappearing on the streets, but you didn't know or like them anyway. \n\n Are you really going to oppose him? Are you really going to stick your neck out for the people who continued to have stake throughout the interwar period while you lost an arm in a steel mill accident? Are you really going to question the visionary leader who worked tirelessly for over 25 years to make this all happen, when the alternative was utter anguish and ruination?",

According to Mill: \n\n - **Higher pleasures** are those associated with intellectual, moral, and emotional growth, such as learning, art, and companionship. \n\n - **Lower pleasures** are those relating to bodily function only, such as food, sleep, or physical comfort. \n\n Crucially, when there is a conflict between the higher and the lower pleasures, *the higher pleasures should prevail*. \n\n It is clearly Mill's position that those who experienced the higher pleasures will know the difference between the two, and the “fool” or “pig” might believe lower pleasures to be sufficient only because they lack the capacity or experience to appreciate higher pleasures.",

    "text": "# 02 \"Might makes right\" \n\n \"Might makes right\" refers to the idea that power alone is the ultimate determinant of what is morally or ethically \"right\". \n\n Simply because the powerful couldn't be stopped. \n\n This power can come in many shapes or forms. In the ancient times it was physical strength, or perhaps tribal lineage. Nowadays we see it in forms of political power, popularity, wealth, qualifications, and hierarchical authority in an organisation. \n\n It's a simplistic yet dangerously appealing idea, and most people would agree that the notion of \"might makes right\" is fundamentally wrong, as it goes against the very principles of civilisation which seeks to rise above the Darwinian laws of the jungle. \n\n But, it quickly gets more complicated if you take the logic just *one step further*...",

    "text": "It would seem contradictory that people's natural instincts are to simultaneously reject the notion that “Might makes right” but accept the proposition that \"Weak makes right.\" \n\n The result however, is the same. \"Weak makes right\" is merely another form of \"Might makes right\" differing only in the definition of or metric applied to the word \"Might\". \n\n In ancient times, barbarians with bulging muscles are perceived as mighty because they're able to effectively use violence to achieve a desired outcome through brute force. \n\n In contemporary society, systems might exist to reward those who are perceived to lack power, which in turn makes them mighty. Societies do this for a variety of reasons, including restorative justice and reducing inequality, to name a few. \n\n But many would shun at the retort that \"might makes right\" and \"weak makes right\" are logically equivalent, and understandably so.  \n\n What, then, is the moral justification for the intrinsic support that people feel for the weaker party? \n\n Is there a rule or law of morality that would allow us to approach a problem like this with *objectivity* and *consistency*?",

Hence the name, Egoism. \n\n - **Altruism**: this one is the opposite of Egoism, asserting that that individuals should only maximise the benefits of others to *the exclusion of the self*. Codified martyrdom, essentially. \n\n Essentially, Egoism and Altruism breaks Utilitarianism into two disjoint sets of the beneficiaries for the maximisation of the good: the others, or the self. \n\n But you know what, let's just go with Utilitarianism, at least it would seem reasonably fair to maximise the goods of everyone, including ourselves. \n\n After all, who can argue with the idea of *the greatest good for the greatest number*?",

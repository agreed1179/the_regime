The clash of everything, everywhere \n\n  If Karl Marx viewed the progression of society as the progression through historical materialism... \n\n Then I would say that history progresses through the fundamental and irreconcilable conflict between the morality of consequences vs the morality of rights. \n\n **all conflicts of political or ethical nature are conflicts between utilitarianism and deontology**. \n\n *This is the central finding of this exegesis.*",
